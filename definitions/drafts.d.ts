 * The MustacheTemplate object support rendering of templates using the [Mustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_%28template_system%29) template style.
 *
 * Mustache templates offer advanced features for iterating over items, creating conditional blocks of text and more. This is still a bit of an experimental feature, please send feedback if you are finding edge cases or are interested in more functionality in this area.
 *
 * The object can be used in one of two ways, by passing a specific template as a string and rendering it, or by passing a path to a subdirectory of the `iCloud Drive/Drafts/Library/Templates` folder which can contain more than one Mustache style templates (with file extension `.mustache`), and then rendering them. The late method has the advantage of supporting the use of partial templates in the same folder.
 *
 * For details on using Mustache templates, we recommend reviewing [tutorials](https://www.bersling.com/2017/09/22/the-ultimate-mustache-tutorial/).
 *
 * ### About Passing Data to Templates
 *
 * When rendering Mustache templates, you pass the template itself and a data object which contains the values available to insert. The data object should be a Javascript object with keys and values. Values can be basic data types (numbers, strings, dates) and also arrays or nested objects which can be iterated using conventions of the Mustache syntax.
