# drafts

Monaco editor for writing actions in [Drafts 5](https://getdrafts.com/). There are standalone [typescript definitions](https://github.com/xavdid/drafts/blob/master/definitions/drafts.d.ts) included if you want to write code separately too.

## Motivation

This app was born from a desire to write JS code for Drafts, but lacking tools I had come to enjoy.

## Future

I'd like to add ESLint support!
